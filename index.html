          The first step to making your cat famous is by building a steady fan
          base on social media! You can start by following other animal
          influencers and learn from what they do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t stop at clicking photos of your cat in fun poses, wearing a cape
          and looking like he’s ready to take over the world! Push the creative
          boundaries to bring..
